# ft_printf

**A project of School 21.**

In this project i had to recode **printf** function.

My function manages the following conversions: **cspdiuxX%** and the following flags: **-0**. It also manages field width and precision.

Installation:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/vadsamokh/ft_printf && cd ft_printf && make
```

The function will be stored in **libftprintf.a** library. You can compile it with test file:
```
$ gcc libftprintf.a test.c
```

You are free to change test script in **test.c** as you wish.
